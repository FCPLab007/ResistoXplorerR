# ResistoXplorerR
R code repository for the ResistoXplorer web server. ResistoXplorer is a web-based, visual analytics tool to assist researchers to perform exploratory data analysis on abundance profiles and resistome signatures generated from AMR metagenomics studies. The key features of ResistoXplorer include: 

1. Support for a wide array of common as well as advanced methods for composition profiling, visualization and exploratory data analysis;
2. Comprehensive support for various data normalization methods coupled with standard as well as more recent statistical and machine learning algorithms;
3. Support for a variety of methods for performing vertical data integrative analysis on paired metagenomic datasets (i.e. taxonomic and resistome abundance profiles);
4. Comprehensive support for ARG functional annotations along with their microbe and phenotype associations based on data collected from more than 10 reference and curated databases;
5. A powerful and fully featured network visualization for intuitive exploration of ARG-microbal host associations, incorporated with functional annotations enrichment analysis support.
 
ResistoXplorer is freely accessible from: http://resistoxplorer.no/. Users can locally reproduce the results by using the R commandline history generated while analyzing the data on the server.
